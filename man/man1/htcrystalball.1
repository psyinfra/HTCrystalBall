.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
calculates how many jobs (of a user\[hy]specified number and size) can run
on an HTCondor pool.
It also can estimate runtime (core hours and wall time) and node\[hy]specific
matching (aiding those with node\[hy]level licensing restrictions).
.Pp
The arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.
.It Ar \-c | Ar \-\-cpu
The number of CPU cores per job.
.
.It Ar \-r | Ar \-\-ram
The amount of RAM per job, including a unit (e.g. 10G).
.
.It OPTIONS
.
.It Fl h | Fl Fl help
Prints a summary of
.Nm Ap s
command\[hy]line options and exits.
.
.It Fl g | Fl Fl gpu
The number of GPUs per job.
.
.It Fl d | Fl Fl disk
The disk space per job, including a unit (e.g. 50G).
.
.It Fl j | Fl Fl jobs
The number of jobs to be executed.
.
.It Fl t | Fl Fl time
The estimated time for one job to be executed.
.
.It Fl m | Fl Fl maxnodes
The maximum number of nodes jobs can be executed on.
Sometimes necessary due to software license restrictions.
.
.It Fl v | Fl Fl verbose
Prints a table listing each node, its resources, and proposed usage.

.Sh EXAMPLES
Basic output:
.Dl htcrystalball \-\-cpu 1 \-\-ram 7500M \-\-jobs 1
.
Verbose:
.Dl htcrystalball \-\-cpu 1 \-\-ram 7500M \-\-jobs 1 \-\-verbose
.
Big job with runtime projection:
.Dl htcb \-\-cpu 16 \-\-ram 16G \-\-disk 100G \-\-jobs 20 \-\-time 5h
.
Limit to a maximum number of nodes:
.Dl htcb \-\-cpu 16 \-\-ram 16G \-\-disk 100G \-\-maxnodes 2 \-\-jobs 20 \-\-time 5h
.
GPU job:
.Dl htcb \-\-cpu 1 \-\-gpu 1 \-\-ram 8G \-\-disk 64G \-\-jobs 10 \-\-time 2h
